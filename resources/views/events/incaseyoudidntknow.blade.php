			<p>
				A common problem statement, relating to our college which you yourselves would have experienced, will be given to all the groups just before the start of the event. Then, one mentor from 180DC will join each team.
			</p>
			<p>
				The mentor will lay out the structure, solve doubts, and guide the discussion in a streamlined manner. The participants can use external resources (internet and books, provided they bring their own). After one and a half hours, the teams stop their discussion. Each team presents their solution (in the form of a ppt) to the whole room and also to the team members of 180DC.
