            <ul>
                <li>Participants come in groups of 4.</li>
                <li>One common problem statement, relating to our college which they themselves would have experienced is given to all the groups at the venue just before the start of the event.</li>
                <li>One mentor from 180DC will join each team.</li>
                <li>The mentor will lay put the structure, solve doubts, and guide the discussion in a streamlined manner. The participants can use external resources(Internet and books had they brought any).</li>
                <li>After one and a half hours, the teams stop their discussion. Each team presents their solution (in the form of a ppt) to the whole room and also to the team members of 180DC.</li>
                <li>These 180DC Judges judge the presentations, ask questions, and announce the results.</li>
            </ul>
