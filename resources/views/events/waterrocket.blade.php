			<div>
				<p>Take your first big step to propel yourself into the world of aerodynamics!</p>
				<p>Water Rocket is a mechanical event that involves the fabrication of a rocket whose fuel/thrust for flight is obtained by the use of water that is expelled at a large air pressure. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion. The prerequisites for this event would include basic knowledge in fabrication and materials, and physical calculations involving thrust, air pressure, etc. The event tests the range of the Rocketâ€™s flight</p>

			<b class="header">Event Format:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>This event requires participating teams to design a water rocket that is completely powered by the thrust delivered by water expelled at high pressure.</li>
					<li>The event consists of only ONE round, <strong> Range test </strong> . Here, the maximum range is tested. The distance between the launch pad and the point of landing is measured (in meters) and taken to be the points in that round.</li>
				</ul>

			<b class="header">Rules:</b>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>Maximum of 3 participants per team.</li>
					<li>The rocket and its components must be handmade. No readymade rocket is allowed.</li>
					<li>The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2.5L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure. More than one bottle can be used but the total volume must be less than 2.5L.</li>
					<li>The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) will be provided at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should NOT exceed 60 psi.</li>
					<li>Water that is to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organisers. Calculations regarding the amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.</li>
					<li>Two trials will be given to each team and the best of two will be taken into consideration.</li>
					<li>The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launch pad. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other devices that may assist launching are strictly prohibited. In other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.</li>
					<li>Water rockets can have multiple stages. Parachute and gliding mechanisms are permitted.</li>
					<li>Use of electronic components and chemical explosives are banned.</li>
					<li>The point where the rocket hits the ground first will be taken as the point of landing and measurements will be taken considering this point.</li>
					<li>Teams are advised to get more than one water rocket, in case of any damage to one of the rockets. However, all the water rockets must be identical.</li>
					<li>A team will be either disqualified or given another chance to remodel if the model is found to be dangerous in any way. The decision of the organisers is final and binding in this and all other conditions.</li>
				</ul>

			<b class="header">Judging Criteria:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>The judgment is completely based on the marking scheme as mentioned in the event format.</li>
				<li>The organisers decide to permit the launching of the rocket after inspection of both the rocket and launch pad considering factors such as safety and the permissible mechanisms mentioned in the rules. In such cases, the organisers&rsquo; decision is final and binding.</li>
			</ul>

			<b class="header">FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):</b>
				<ul>
					<li>How many trials will I get?<br />Each team will be allowed only two trials.</li>
					<li>How much time will be given for one launch?<br /> 10-15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Will I get an additional trial if the rocket fails to launch i.e. if the rocket doesn&rsquo;t leave the Launchpad itself?<br /> You will not get any additional trial unless you have one trial left out of the two allowed trials.</li>
					<li>Are we allowed to repair our models if it gets damaged on the spot?<br />Yeah, if you can manage to do it within the prescribed time limit permitted by the organisers.</li>
					<li>Can we make changes to our model before launching?<br /> Yeah, but if you exceed 15 minutes you will lose one trial.</li>
					<li>Are more than three members allowed?<br /> No, the maximum number of members per team should not exceed three at any cost.</li>
