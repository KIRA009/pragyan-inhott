			<b class="header">Event Description:</b>
			<p>Ever wondered what it takes to put the Intel in intellect? Pragyan in association with Spider lets you have your very first crack at the big leagues where logic meets practical circuits. Dive headfirst into this event which may be small in length but is big on gains.</p>

			<b class="header">Event Format:</b>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li> You can relish this event in three amazing courses each more challenging and thought provoking than the last.</li>
					<li>The First course will be served with a single task and the participants will have to work on the problem statement and present the output on the day of the event. Depending on the output obtained and the methodology used to obtain it, points [maximum of 25] will be awarded</li>
					<li>The Second course will be spiced up with 3 tasks which will be released 3 days before the event, each of varied difficulty and will carry points accordingly. [Easy=10; Medium=20; Hard=30;]</li>
					<li>The final course will have you brave an on-site hackathon in which participating teams will work on the given problem statement and try to obtain the required output within 3 hours. [maximum of 25 points]</li>

					COURSE ONE - Task 0<br>
You are a cryptographer working in the Defence. During wartime, the enemy troops are sending signals to spies in your army. Now the first step in the process of decryption is going to be finding the frequency of the tapped signal. This is where your task begins: using just a microcontroller you have to design a system which measures the frequency of the signal. You have to print the value of the frequency in the serial monitor. One good news here is that you know that the signal is a squarewave signal of a particular frequency which does not exceed a few kilohertz.</p>

<p>POINTS DISTRIBUTION</p>
Algorithm: 10<br>
Code: 15<br>
Accuracy: 25<br>
The accuracy of your system will be tested with various signals of frequencies upto a few kilohertz on the day of the event.<br>
PS: Use of simpler and more accurate algorithms will be rewarded.
