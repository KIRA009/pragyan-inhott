			<b class="header">FAQs:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Can I attempt the tasks any order?
					<br>
					Yes. You can even start with the most difficult task and then proceed to easier tasks. However completing all the tasks partially will fetch you lesser marks than finishing any single task completely
				</li>
				<li>
					Can I use electronic circuits like 555 timers and flip flop ICs?
					<br>
					This event is to test your skills in using a microcontroller and coding in embedded C. Hence no ICs are allowed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Can I attempt bonus tasks without completing the main tasks?
					<br>
					The tasks are designed in such a way that you need to finish the main task before you can attempt the corresponding bonus task.
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the time given for each task?
					<br>
					There is no time limit separately for each task. Youâ€™ll be given a time limit of 2-3 hrs in total for completing all the tasks.
