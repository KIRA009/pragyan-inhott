			<div>
				<p>Inspired by BAHFest, Pragyan InHOTT presents EleMENTAL - a dose of Mind-Blowingly Entertaining Nonsensical Theories About Life.</p>
				<p>The objective of this event is to support a ridiculous theory from any walk of life by using genuine scientific laws and principles, statistic data, graphs and diagrams.</p>
				<p>The theories to be explained can range from why earphones get tangled so easily to why women are obsessed with shopping. Your knowledge of science is going to be your only potent weapon to explain these theories.</p>
				<p>So, put on your thinking caps and be prepared to explain the unexplained. And yes, we have brownie points for humorous explanations! Get ready to explore the funny side of science at EleMENTAL.</p>
